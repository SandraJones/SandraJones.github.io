	  	<p class = "contentSmall">I studied Chemical Technology in college and received an A.A.S. degree in Chemical Technology. While working full-time, I finished my B.S.B.A. degree, majoring in Finance. Through the years following graduation, I worked in accounting, supervisory, and management roles that I thoroughly enjoyed, although never working directly in finance. These positions enabled me to hone my supervisory and management skills. 
			</p>
	  	<p class = "contentSmall">When my eldest son was born, I decided to pursue off-shift employment to reduce day-care time. This led me to working as a Computer Operator. This was my first exposure in the workplace to computer programming. After a year and a half of working midnight shifts, I took a 12-year career hiatus during which I worked as a preschool teacher at a few local churches. During this time I also started an apparel business with a mall kiosk.
			</p>
	  	<p class = "contentSmall">Once my youngest son was in middle school, I re-entered the workforce as a warehouse temp and quickly advanced to customer service and ultimately account management working on three separate e-commerce platforms for 18 different clients.  Again I was exposed to computer programmers, but this time they were building webstores for clients. This led me to look into software bootcamps, and the school I chose, Nashville Software School. We completed a front-end and a back-end capstone so that we could work full stack development under the supervision of senior developers when we graduated.
			</p>
		<p class = "contentSmall">I was able to secure my first software engineer position and enjoyed it, but the long daily commute (3 hours) was incompatible with my family's needs. So I took a break and have been managing a contractor who is working a major remodel of our homes. During this time, I have networked, attended conferences, (Agile, Security, etc.), and reviewed online training and worked on learning new languages. My focus is on C# .NET because that is my preferred language, but I am open to learning whatever is needed in my next position.  ] One of my strengths is encouraging my co-workers and showing up optimistic and ready to learn. 
			</p>
		<p class = "contentSmall">Some of my favorite activities are playing cards and board games, crafting (card creation, scrapbooking and quilting), walking, and reading non-fiction. My passion is politics, so I read extensively about current events. I maintain a website as webmaster for a local charity, Angels of Heart. The mission is close to my heart.
			</p>
