			  	<h5 class = "aboutMe"> About Me</h5>
			  	<p class = "contentSmall">Three things to know about me: I absolutely love coding; I have a killer work ethic; and I am a sponge for knowledge.</p> 
			  	<p class = "contentSmall">Coding requires constant learning, so it satisfies my curiosity and need for knowledge.  I love the inspiration and the satisfaction I get from constantly solving challenges. When I can't sleep at night, I think up apps!. My career began as a Computer Operator and then Supervisor in a Data Center where I got my first exposure to IT. I learned key organizational skills, as well.
					</p>
			  	<p class = "contentSmall">I worked in a fulfillment center working my way up to managing e-Commerce as an Account Manager with many accounts in three short years. That position further deepened my interest in coding because I wanted to work at the platform level and contribute more to my company's bottom line. I saw first-hand how integral developers are to a company's success. 
					</p>
			  	<p class = "contentSmall">Although I like to work solo on a project, I also enjoy collaboration and think some of the best work comes from it. My strategy and focus are toward functionality followed by style.  Things have to work flawlessly before you make them cool.  I greatly enjoy the Dev community in Nashville and am active in several organizations. I enjoy networking, learning and volunteering in this community, most recently at WITT, BarCamp2016, and Nodevember2016.</p>
			  	<p class = "contentSmall">I would appreciate the opportunity to explore how my skills and work ethic might fit with your company's coding needs. Please contact me at sandynashv@gmail.com. Thank you!
