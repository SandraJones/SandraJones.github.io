					  	<h5 class = "aboutMe"> A little about me...</h5>
					  	<p class = "contentSmall">My career began in business and included work as a Computer Operator and then Supervisor in a Data Center.  That was my first direct work exposure to IT.  As I learned more, I found more to learn, opening up new areas of interest to me.  Although I deeply enjoyed my job, I left it to focus more directly on my family and to become a stay-at-home parent for 12 years, working part-time in childcare so that I could be with my children.</p>
					  	<p class = "contentSmall">When I began searching for a job, I realized my business experience was not as marketable as I had hoped.  I would need to begin again at a much lower level of pay and responsibility.  I took a job in a warehouse filling orders and worked my way up to managing e-Commerce as an Account Manager over the course of about three years.  That position further deepened my interest in coding because I wanted to work at the platform level and contribute more to my employer. Our company built Drupal websites for artists and also spun up Shopify stores for organizations and artists. I saw first-hand how developers can contribute to a company's bottom-line. Unfortunately, I was effected by a company downsizing July 28th, 2016.</p>
					  	<p class = "contentSmall">What do I love about coding?  Primarily, the fact that ongoing learning is an integral part of a great career. I love the inspiration and the satisfaction I get when I learn something new!  The endless possibilities that lie in coding projects, intrigues me, and I like to think of apps to create. I enjoy the opportunity to work solo and to work cooperatively on a team. I think some of the best work comes from collaboration.  My focus has been on learning functionality first and style second. I am still learning more each day about styling. One of the unexpected benefits of going down the path of software development, is the Dev community in Nashville. I enjoy networking, learning, and volunteering in this community, most recently at WITT, BarCamp2016, and Nodevember2016.  If you need a team member with a great work ethic and would like to discuss our mutual interests, please contact me at sandynashv@gmail.com.</p>
