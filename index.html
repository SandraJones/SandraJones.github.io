			<p>We are creating very simple single page applications for college graduates to enhance their competitiveness and marketability upon graduation. These simple sites allow each graduate to shine a light upon the achievements that make them most proud. Each site is affordable and meant to convey the special personality and unique skills each graduate has to offer.</p>

			<p class="contentOne">This project site was created by a group of volunteers, which I simply guided. AOH is a non-profit whose mission is to help those who are forgotten.  They focus on the homeless, the elderly, and children in El Salvador. </p>

		  	<p class = "contentSmall">I studied Chemical Technology in college and received an A.A.S. degree in Chemical Technology. While working full-time, I finished my B.S.B.A. degree, majoring in Finance. Through the years following graduation, I worked in accounting, supervisory, and management roles that I thoroughly enjoyed, although never working directly in finance. These positions enabled me to hone my supervisory and management skills. </p>
		  	<p class = "contentSmall">
		  	I decided to enroll in Nashville Software School to enlarge my skill set and add tech skills to my portfolio. While at NSS, I completed a front-end and a back-end capstone so that I could work full stack development under the supervision of senior developers when I graduated.</p>
			<p class = "contentSmall">I was able to secure my first software engineer position and enjoyed it, but the long daily commute (3 hours) was incompatible with my family's needs. So I took a break to manage the remodel of our two homes. During this time, I have networked, attended conferences, (Agile, Security, etc.), managed one of our homes as an AirBnB, and started a company, GradWebsite.com.</p>
			<p class = "contentSmall">Some of my favorite non-work activities are playing cards and board games, crafting (card creation, scrapbooking and quilting), walking, travel, and reading non-fiction. My passion is politics, so I read extensively about current events. I maintain a website as webmaster for a local charity, Angels of Heart. The mission is close to my heart.</p>
			<p class = "contentSmall">Thank you for visiting my website! My contact information is on my resume which may be downloaded above, or simply email me at sandynashv@gmail.com.</p>
