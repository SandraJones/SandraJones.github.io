  	<p class = "contentSmall">I really enjoy learning and teaching others what I have learned.  My interest in coding began when I was a Computer Operator in a Data Center at Emdeon.  When I discovered the NSS boot camp, I was immediately interested in learning from professionals.  Coding requires constant learning, so it satisfies my curiosity and need for knowledge.  I love the inspiration and the satisfaction I get from constantly solving challenges.  
		</p>
  	<p class = "contentSmall">I worked in a fulfillment center working my way up to managing e-Commerce as an Account Manager with many accounts in three short years. That position further deepened my interest in coding. I saw first-hand how integral developers are to a company's success. 
		</p>
  	<p class = "contentSmall">The applications listed here are solo projects, but I enjoy working as part of a team, and did so on numerous projects during my year at Nashville Software School.  My strategy and focus are toward functionality followed by style.  I enjoy networking, learning and volunteering in this community, most recently at WITT, BarCamp2016, and Nodevember2016. Thank you for visiting my site!
